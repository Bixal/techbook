# Bixal Solutions Privacy Incident Response Plan (IRP)

## Applicability

**Note:**  This Incident Response Plan applies to systems for which Bixal Solutions and third party
contractors. Individual systems may have a tailored version of this Privacy Incident Response
Plan or in some cases a completely unique Privacy Incident Response Plan will be developed.
All Bixal Solutions employees are aware of the procedures outlined herein.

## Overview

This Privacy Incident Response Plan provides baseline guidance for the Bixal Solutions Team's
process for responding to privacy incidents of a Bixal Solutions IRCP
managed system, product or service ("system"). It outlines roles and
responsibilities during and after incidents, and it lays out the steps Bixal
take to resolve them.

## Definitions

**PII** as “any information that permits the identity of an individual to be directly or indirectly
inferred, including any other information which is linked or linkable to that individual,
regardless of whether the individual is a United States citizen, lawful permanent resident,
visitor to the U.S., or employee or contractor to the Department”.

**Sensitive PII** as “personally identifiable information, which if lost, compromised, or disclosed
without authorization, could result in substantial harm, embarrassment, inconvenience, or
unfairness to an individual.” Examples of Sensitive PII include, but are not limited to:

1. Social Security numbers (SSN)
1. drivers license or state identification numbers
1. passport numbers
1. Alien Registration numbers
1. financial account numbers
1. biometric identifiers
1. Other data, when combined, may also constitute Sensitive PII, such as:
   1. citizenship or immigration status
   1. medical information
   1. salary
   1. ethnic or religious affiliation
   1. personal email address, address, and phone
   1. account passwords
   1. date of birth
   1. criminal history
   1. mother’s maiden name

## Obligations

As an employee, appointee, detailee, intern, contractor, grantee,
or consultant (hereafter, Bixal personnel), you have an obligation to report suspected or confirmed
privacy incidents in a timely manner. By reporting a privacy incident in
a timely manner, DHS personnel can initiate the privacy incident response process, which is
required by federal law and policy.

The PICR is an instructional “roadmap” for responding to privacy incidents,
addressing reporting to resolution of an incident, as well as developing lessons learned. This
guidance describes the roles and responsibilities of Bixal personnel,
including employees, supervisors, Component Privacy Officers/Privacy Points of Contact (PPOCs) as
well as the responsible Security Operations Center (Information Security Office).

All have a critical role at the outset in establishing facts that will be needed,
not only to contain the privacy incident, but also to identify appropriate mitigations and
lessons learned.

Privacy incidents, whether accidental or malicious, can pose specific risks to individuals, because
there is an increasing recognition that personal information such as
Social Security numbers, financial account information, health information, and biometric data,
is valuable and can be reverse engineered with a potential for great
public harm. Therefore, it is crucial that DHS personnel be able to identify and
report a suspected or confirmed privacy incident. Taking immediate action to report a
suspected or confirmed privacy incident is the first step in containing, mitigating, and remediating a privacy
incident.

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Director of Technology

* Serves as the senior employee responsible for oversight of privacy incident
management.
* Responsible for determining whether Bixal's response can be conducted at
the direction of the Information Security Officer assigned to the component, or
if the Office of Information Security will lead the response. The Director may choose
not to convene the BISO if the response can be conducted at the Component level. At a
minimum, the BISO is convened when a privacy incident constitutes a “major incident,” as
defined in OMB M-18-0210 and subsequent OMB Guidance.
* Leads and manages the BISO if convened.
* Evaluates the sensitivity of the PII involved in the privacy incident and assesses the risk of
harm to individuals affected by the privacy incident.
* Directs BISO or Component Information Security Officer to gather, analyze, and preserve any
and all evidence necessary to support an investigation of a privacy incident.
* Consults with the Chief Information Officer (CIO) and Chief Information Security Officer
(CISO) to determine whether a privacy incident constitutes a major incident pursuant to
OMB M-18-02, and subsequent OMB Guidance, which may trigger Congressional
reporting requirements under the FISMA.

### Bixal Information Security Office

* Supports the Director of Technology to identify appropriate course of action with
respect to any major privacy incident investigation, remedy options, resource allocation,
notification to impacted individuals, risk mitigation, interagency engagement, and the
timeliness, content, means, sources, and general appropriateness of other external
notification. After consultation with the BISO, director provides
recommendations to the CISO or representitive member, including timeliness, contents, means, sources,
and general appropriateness of notifications.
* The BISO includes, at a minimum, the following officials or their representatives:
  * Vice President of Agile Delivery
  * Director of Technology
  * Chief Executive Officer
* As necessary, depending on the type of incident, the Director of Technology may
request dditional subject matter experts to join and assist the BISO. For example, if the
privacy incident involves financial information, the DHS Chief Privacy Officer may request
the Chief Financial Officer to join the BISO.

### United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT)

* Serves as the designated central reporting organization and repository within the Federal
Government for federal incident data, communicates and coordinates with the
information security officer to obtain updates regarding the privacy incident, and
is responsible for notifying appropriate authorities of the privacy incident, including the
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) within one hour of the privacy incident, all in
accordance with FISMA.

## Identifying and Processing a Privacy Incident

### Privacy Incident Identification

As soon as a privacy incident is discovered, Bixal personnel have an obligation to immediately report
the privacy incident to their supervisor, program manager, information security officer,
or responsible IT Help Desk. If the privacy incident is reported to the program
manager, supervisor, or IT Help Desk, the privacy incident must be referred or reported to the
information security officer or Director of Technology.

Once discovered, Bixal personnel should report privacy incidents that are either suspected and/or
confirmed. A privacy incident involving PII should be viewed as the loss of control, compromise,
unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized acquisition, or any similar occurrence when

1. An unauthorized user accesses PII
1. An authorized user accesses PII for an other than authorized purpose.13

In order to encourage effective and efficient responses to privacy incidents, it is imperative not only
that the Department train personnel on privacy reporting procedures, but also that it fosters an
environment in which individuals feel comfortable reporting a privacy incident. A quick response to
a newly discovered privacy incident can spare affected individuals adverse consequences as well
as save significant time and resources for Bixal and the Federal Government.
Applicable consequences for failing to comply with safeguarding and reporting requirements can
be serious, and may include reprimand, suspension, removal, or other actions in accordance with
applicable law and Bixal policy. At a minimum, Bixal will remove the authority to access information
or systems from any individual who demonstrates a disregard or a pattern of not safeguarding PII.
Finally, the BISO or Director of technology, will determine
specific details pertaining to an open or closed privacy incident as whether to disclose to any
person without an authorized need to know.

### Privacy Incident Reporting: Initial Intake and Starting a Security Event Investigation and Notification (SEIN)

When the privacy incident is identified, the component manager and information
security officer will need to collect specific information about the
nature of the privacy incident to create a suspected or confirmed security event
notification (SEN). The SEN, may potentially be distributed to:

* Bixal Personnel
* Bixal Information Security Office
* US-CERT
* Individuals affected in the privacy incident

While not all of the information may be available at the outset,
the information security officer should gather as much information as possible for
population of the SEN. In major breaches updates should be communicated daily.
This information should include basic facts regarding when the incident occurred
and when the incident was discovered, as well as information about the nature of the incident
and whether the suspected incident involves PII, including Sensitive PII.
In addition, the Component should also record, in the SEN, any further factual
information that will facilitate the handling of the incident as well as actions taken to contain
the incident.

Once the SEN has been established, the responsible information security officer, program manager,
and Director of Technology will continue to coordinate to gather information about the privacy incident.
The information security officer evaluates this information in
context and determines whether or not the facts support the conclusion that a privacy incident may
have occurred. As part of the initial assessment, the information security officer will
determine whether the incident involves PII, as well as whether the incident involves information from
other Components or organizations.

The information security officer will contact law enforcement authorites with the BISO
when (a) criminal activity is suspected, and (b) the Sensitive PII privacy incident originated or
occurred within a classified secured environment (i.e., Closed Storage Processing Area; Open
Storage Area; or Sensitive Compartment Information Facility).

### Privacy Incident Assessment: PII Determination

The information security officer will need to assess the privacy incident to determine
whether there are other considerations that require consultation and notice.
To facilitate this assessment, the information security officer should
also consult with the BISO. The information security officer will need to determine
whether Sensitive PII was involved. In addition to Sensitive PII, the information
security officer should consult the program manager to determine if certain financial
and/or certain health information was involved, if the incident was caused by a contractor,
if the incident involved information from multiple components, or if criminal activity is suspected.
Incident assessment factors include:

1. **Sensitive PII**:

    The information security officer should determine whether the incident involves
    Sensitive PII. Sensitive PII is personally identifiable information, which if lost, compromised, or
    disclosed without authorization, could result in substantial harm, embarrassment,
    inconvenience, or unfairness to an individual.
    Sensitive PII requires stricter handling guidelines because of the increased risk to an individual
    if the data is compromised. Some categories of PII are sensitive as stand-alone data
    elements, including a Social Security number (SSN) or driver’s license or state identification
    number. Other data elements such as citizenship or immigration status, medical information,
    ethnic, religious, sexual orientation, or lifestyle information, in conjunction with the identity of
    an individual (directly or indirectly inferred), are also Sensitive PII.

    In many instances, the information security officer must use a best judgment standard
    in assessing the sensitivity of PII in its context. For example, an office contact list contains PII (e.g., name, phone number). In this context, the information probably would not be
    considered sensitive. However, the same information in a roster of law enforcement
    personnel probably would be considered sensitive information. In assessing the levels of risk
    and harm, consider the data element(s) in light of their context and the broad range of
    potential harms flowing from their disclosure to unauthorized individuals.

1. **Contractor Obligations**:

    The PICR applies to all Bixal personnel, including contractors. Contractors are obligated to
    comply with all Bixal privacy policies and procedures. For the purposes of privacy incident
    handling, contractor responsibilities are nearly identical to those of a Bixal employee.
    Contractors should report incidents to an information security officer or BISO.
    However, contractors must also report any privacy incident to their official Contracting
    Officer’s Representative (COR). Moreover, the information security officer must
    continue to consult and work through the COR regarding any matters regarding the contractor.
    At this stage, the COR and the information security officer should review the contract
    for inclusion of the contractor’s breach notification or incident response responsibilities.

1. **Financial Information:**

    The information security officer should also determine, to the extent possible and at
    the earliest stage of the privacy incident, whether the privacy incident involves
    governmentissued credit cards or individuals’ financial information, such as bank
    account numbers used for direct deposit of credit card reimbursements, or any benefit
    information. If so, the information security officer should immediately notify the the Bixal
    chief financial officer or federal COR representitive. The BISO will notify the affected bank(s)
    or Bixal human resources team. The information security officer will update the Privacy Incident
    Report to reflect the CFO’s notification of the affected bank(s). Escalation to the
    CFO is warranted when the privacy incident involves CFO Designated Financial Systems.

1. **Health Information:**

    The information security officer should also determine, to the extent possible and at
    the earliest stage of the privacy incident, whether the privacy incident involves individually
    identifiable health information, such as demographic data, that relates to:

    * the individual’s past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition,
    * the provision of health care to the individual,
    * the past, present, or future payment for the provision of health care to the individual, and
    that identifies the individual or for which there is a reasonable basis to believe can be
    used to identify the individual.
    * individually identifiable health information includes many common identifiers (e.g., name,
    address, birth date, Social Security number).

    Incidents involving HIPAA are to be reported to the U.S. Department of Health and Human
    Services Office for Civil Rights as necessary.

1. **Multiple Components:**

    The information security officer should also determine whether the privacy incident
    involves PII from multiple Components. The Privacy Incident Report should accurately reflect
    the information and Components affected. The information security officer may also work
    through the BISO to facilitate communication with the other
    Component information security officers about the privacy incident to ensure they are aware of
    the incident and the mitigation and remediation in the Components is consistent.

### Privacy Incident Reporting: Distinguishing between Minor and Major Incidents

Once the assessment is complete, the information security officer determines
whether the privacy incident is a major incident, which requires congressional
notifcation, or a minor incident.
A minor incident is defined as “an incident that due to proper functioning of a security control
is not likely to impact the Bixal mission or a critical Federal assets. Minor incidents do not
require immediate leadership notification. Further, a minor incident meets one or more of the
following criteria:

* The incident impacts the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of a non-critical system or
non-sensitive data.
* The incident relates to a minor policy violation.

A privacy incident constitutes a major privacy incident when it involves PII that, if exfiltrated,
modified, deleted, or otherwise compromised, is likely to result in demonstrable harm to the national
security interests, foreign relations, or economy of the United States, or to the public confidence,
civil liberties, or public health and safety of the American people. An unauthorized modification of,
unauthorized deletion of, unauthorized exfiltration of, or unauthorized access to 100,000 or more
individuals’ PII constitutes a major privacy incident.

The Director of Technology, in coordination with the BISO, will first determine whether the
privacy incident is considered a “major incident” that involves PII. There are several criteria to
evaluate in this definition and there may be instances in which a privacy
incident may meet the criteria above but not affect 100,000 or more individuals’ PII. Those instances
are no less significant any may indeed warrant the convening of the BISO.

It is for this reason that during the incident assessment phase, the Component information security
officer be cognizant of whether the incident meets the definition of a major privacy incident and not
look at applying the classification of the privacy incident only because the 100,000 affected individuals’ PII threshold is met.
To facilitate this determination, the information security officer will identify the system of
records notice (SORN), privacy impact assessment (PIA), and/or other existing compliance
documents that may apply to the compromised PII or SPII. The information security officer will
provide this information to the Director of Technology at the
Bixal Information Security Office.
Once the determination has been received, the Director of Technology, in coordination with the
CISO and COR, will validate whether the privacy incident is a major incident that involves PII.

## Congressional Notification

If the privacy incident is validated as a major incident that involves PII, the Bixal Director of
Technology must notify appropriate congressional committees no later than seven days after
the date on which DHS has reasonably concluded that a major privacy incident occurred. The DHS Chief
Privacy Officer must supplement that seven day notification to Congress with updates within
a reasonable period of time. In addition, DHS Chief Privacy Officer must also supplement the seven day
notification with a report no later than 30 days after a major privacy incident is discovered. The DHS
Chief Privacy Officer will coordinate with OLA, as a member of the Breach Response Team, as
described below, for such notification to these committees.

## Assessing the Risk of Harm to Individuals Impacted by a Privacy Incident (Risk Assement)

All privacy incidents require a technical investigation, in addition to the facts gathered
at the initial incident intake, in order to collect the information required to conduct a
risk assessment and propose appropriate mitigations.
In any privacy incident involving PII, DHS must assess the risk of harm to individuals
impacted by a privacy incident. This assessment is based on three factors:

* Nature and sensitivity of the PII
* Likelihood of access and use of PII
* Type of Privacy Incident

While the Director of Technology is ultimately accountable for ensuring the assessment of the risk
of harm to individuals, the following considerations and evaluations will be carried out for major or
minor privacy incidents either by the BRT (overseen by the DHS Privacy Office, Director of Privacy
Incidents), or the Component Privacy Officer/PPOC. A thorough risk assessment will help identify
appropriate mitigation measures. The assessment also helps support the production of materials that
may be needed to facilitate notification. It is important to remember, however, that the results of
the assessment and any recommendations must be provided to the DHS Chief Privacy Officer, who
provides recommendations to the Secretary regarding the issuance of notification to affected
individuals, including the timeliness, contents, means, sources, and general appropriateness of the
notification.
The range of potential harms associated with the loss or compromise of PII is broad. A number of
possible harms associated with the loss or compromise of PII must be considered. Such harms may
include:
 The effect of a breach of confidentiality or fiduciary responsibility
 The potential for blackmail
 The disclosure of private facts, mental anguish, and emotional distress
 The disclosure of address information for victims of abuse
 The potential for secondary uses of the information that could result in fear or uncertainty
 The unwarranted exposure leading to humiliation or loss of self-esteem
Finally, as with other tasks, it is also important for the Component Privacy Officer/PPOC to update
the enterprise incident database as to the risk assessment findings.
