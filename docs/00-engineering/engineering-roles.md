## Skills Description

* #### Agile mindset
  You know about agile methodology and can apply an agile mindset to all aspects of your work. You can work in a fast-paced, evolving environment and use an iterative method and flexible approach to enable rapid delivery. You are unafraid to take risks, willing to learn from mistakes and appreciate the importance of agile project delivery for digital projects in government. You can ensure the team knows what each other is working on and how this relates to practical government objectives and user needs.

* **Communication**. You can communicate effectively across organizational, technical and political boundaries, understanding the context. You know how to make complex and technical information and language simple and accessible for non-technical audiences. You can apply foundational concepts of layout, spacing, color, type, iconography, use of imagery to ensure that content is legible and readable and that users see and understand interactions. You can advocate and communicate what a team does to create trust and authenticity and can respond to challenge.

* **Team collaboration**. You can contribute to the work of the organization, building successful teams through understanding team styles and influencing as well as motivating team members. You know how to give and receive constructive feedback, facilitating the feedback loop. You can facilitate conflict resolution within teams, ensure the team is transparent and that the work is understood externally. You can help teams maintain a focus on delivery while being aware of the importance of professional development.

* **Working within constraints**. You understand and can work within given constraints (including but not limited to technology and policy, and regulatory, financial and legal constraints). You know how to challenge constraints that can be changed. You can ensure compliance against constraints by adapting products and services where needed.

* **Leadership and guidance**. You can interpret vision to lead on decisions. You can create a collaborative environment and sustain a good service. You can understand and resolve technical disputes across varying levels of complexity and risk. You can solve issues and unblock problems. You know how to drive teams and set the pace, ensuring teams are delivering. You can manage risk, including effectively managing and tracking the mitigation of risks. You can manage various dependencies across teams, departments and government as a whole.

* **Strategic thinking**. You can take an overall perspective on business issues, events, activities and discuss their wider implications and long-term impact. This could include determining patterns, standards, policies, roadmaps and vision statements. You know how to focus on outcomes rather than solutions and activities.

* #### System Design
  You can define the architecture, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. Systems design could be seen as the application of systems theory to product development. There is some overlap with the disciplines of systems analysis, systems architecture and systems engineering.
  
* #### System Administration
  You are responsible for the upkeep, configuration, and reliable operation of computer systems; especially multi-user computers, such as servers. The system administrator seeks to ensure that the uptime, performance, resources, and security of the computers they manage meet the needs of the users, without exceeding a set budget when doing so.

* #### Application Command Line Tools
  You understand the proper tools to use that allow access and interface with local and remote environments from the command line. You can also create your own scripts and tools that help you work more efficiently and are able to share those with the team.
   
* #### Quality Code and Standards
  You can produce code that follows the standards that the project decides to use for each language. In addition, one should also be aware of how to produce code that follows best practices and is maintainable, commented appropriately, readable (easily scanned), and provides for easy reuse. Knowledge on how to use automated tools such as static analysis, linting, testing, and other tools that allow for quality code and less regression is a huge plus.
   
## Level Description

* #### Working
  A knowledge of how to make something work without any deeper understanding of why it works, or of how to fix it if it breaks.
