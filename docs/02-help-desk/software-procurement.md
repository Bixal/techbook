# Requesting New Software

## Software Installed on the Computer

Bixal maintains a repository of approved software that is installed on your computer through a program called Software Manager. If you need an application, this is the place to start.

If this software requires a licence you should also follow the
[Requesting a License](#requesting-a-license) process.

## Software as a Service

Bixal utilizes many software as a service products. You should **NEVER** use
a personal email address. Doing so is a policy violation and can lead to data loss.

If this service requires a licence you should follow the
[Requesting a License](#requesting-a-license) process.

## Requesting a License

For simple requests with software that has been approved you can use the
following process. If your software has not been approved
please read [Approving New Software](#approving-new-software)

To request software create a [helpdesk ticket](help.bixal.com)
and include the following information:

* Name.
* Email Address.
* The software product you are requesting.
* The license you are requesting (optional but helpful in expediting your request).
* Project and/or Approving project manager or lead.

## Approving Software

Unfortunately approving software can be a time intensive process with multiple stakeholders. If you know you may need software, please make the request as
soon as possible.

More information is always helpful in speeding up the process. But if you don't
have all the information needed, get the request in anyways. Information
technology may be able to help you fill out some of the details.

## Assigning Software

* Ensure the user has created a helpdesk ticket.
  * You may create this for the user in a time sensitive request but the request MUST be tracked.
* Locate the Information System Owners Document in Share point.
  * If there is a current entry for this software locate the system owner, and licensee approver and share the request with them.
  * If there is no owner or entry, escalate to the Information and Security Office to start collecting required information and assessing systems ownership.
  * A provisional license may be given as long as the review process has begun.
* Using that information you can check lastpass for the password.
  * If no password is available, add yourself to the group that manages the email address attached to the account.
  * Reset the password, record it in lastpass, and alert the system owner that the password was reset and this was intentional.
* Assign the seat, alert the user and system owner, and close the ticket.
