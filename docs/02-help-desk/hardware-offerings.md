### A Note on Americans with Disabilities Act

The equipment we purchase and distribute to employees works well for most
employees. However Bixal understands that accommodations for health reasons
should be made. If you feel like the standard equipment Bixal distributes
will have a negative effect, or create challenges for you working at Bixal
you should discuss that with People and Culture, your project manager,
or create a ticket at [https://help.bixal.com](https://help.bixal.com)
to request equipment that will allow you work and communicate with your
peers without creating impedance.
